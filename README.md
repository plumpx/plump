### Introduction
Hey there, fellow coders and curious minds! 👋🏼 Welcome to my humble abode on GitHub! 🏠 I'm a private developer based in the United States 🇺🇸, and I've been coding up a storm since 2009. 💻

My first language love was C and Lua, but don't hold that against me. 😅 I quickly learned that they weren't the best starting points. So, I switched to Python 🐍, and soon added Java ☕ and JavaScript 🌐 to my coding arsenal.

I went to school to learn to code, but let's be real, nothing beats hands-on experience. While in school, I decided to spice things up a bit and double-majored in Criminal Justice 👮‍♀️. I figured, why not add some thrill to my life, right?

I joined GitHub back in 2020, but it wasn't until 2022 that I decided to actually use it. And now, I'm hooked! 🎣 I plan on moving all of my private work here, and I'm excited to dive into some public projects. 🚀

So, if you've got any bright ideas or just want to say hi, hit me up via email or Discord. Let's create something amazing together! 💡 And if you have any good coding jokes, feel free to share them with me. I'm always in the mood for a good laugh. 😂 Thanks for stopping by!
